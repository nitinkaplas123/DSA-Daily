Eulerian Path -:
A Path of edges that visits all the edges in a graph exactly onces.

Note -:
1)not all graph is Eulerian path.
2)be careful from which node you start from Eulerian path.


Eulerian Circuit.
1)An Eulerian path which starts and ends on the same node. 
  Also known as Eulerian cycle.

Note -:
1)Not all graphs have Eulerian circuit.
2)If the graph has Eulerian circuit, then you can start your path from any node.
